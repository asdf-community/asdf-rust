## Build History

[![Build history](https://buildstats.info/github/chart/asdf-community/asdf-rust?branch=master)](https://github.com/asdf-community/asdf-rust/actions)

## Installation

```bash
asdf plugin-add rust https://github.com/asdf-community/asdf-rust.git
```

## Usage

Check [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf) readme for instructions on how to
install & manage versions.

## Configuration

By default, `asdf-rust` installs rust via
[Standalone installers](https://forge.rust-lang.org/infra/other-installation-methods.html)
with all included components.

That include docs, which may easily use around ~50% of total installation. For
this reason, environment variable `RUST_WITHOUT` exists, which takes
comma-separated list of components NOT to install:

```sh
RUST_WITHOUT=rust-docs,rust-other-component asdf install rust 1.51.0

# Or in .profile
export RUST_WITHOUT=rust-docs
```

Also, the Standalone installers do not install source code, which may cause problems in some development environments. If you need the source code, please use the environment variable `RUST_SOURCE` to perform an additional installation.

```sh
RUST_SOURCE=1 asdf install rust 1.51.0
```
